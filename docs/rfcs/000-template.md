## Summary

One-paragraph summary of what this RFC proposes. A reader should be able to
skip the rest of the document if this paragraph is not relevant to them.

## Motivation

What problem does this solve? Why is the current state insufficient? Cite
real code (`file.ts:line`) or behaviour, not abstractions.

## Decision

The proposal itself. Be specific. If the RFC introduces an interface, paste
the TypeScript. If it changes a workflow, show the before and after. Cite
paths and line numbers where they matter.

## Alternatives considered

List the alternatives evaluated. For each, say why it was rejected. The goal
is to show the chosen approach was deliberate, not default.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** what improves.
- **Neutral:** what does not change.
- **Negative / risks:** what gets worse, or what could go wrong.

## How we will know it worked

Concrete, observable success criteria. Not "the code is cleaner" but
"every store under `src/stores/` exposes a `reset()` action, verified by a
new lint rule."

## Open questions

(Optional.) Things this RFC deliberately does not decide. Useful when
scoping a small RFC out of a larger ambition.
